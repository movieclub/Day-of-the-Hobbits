# Day of the Hobbits

## Saturday, 1/23, Marc's House

Join me as I attempt the impossible... the complete Lord of the Rings and Hobbit trilogies, extended editions, back to back, in one sitting:

* 7:00am - The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey
* 10:00am - Break
* 10:30am - The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug
* 1:30pm - Break
* 2:00pm - The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies
* 4:30pm - Hobbit Happy Hour
* 5:30pm - Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
* 9:00pm - Break
* 9:30pm - Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers
* 1:30am - Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King

Like Frodo and the One Ring this is a challenge I must attempt on my own, and I don't expect everyone to attend for the full 23 hours. Feel free to drop in and out at the times convenient for you. If you'd like to see just one movie, I encourage you to come at 4:45 for Hobbit Happy Hour and The Fellowship of the Ring.

Snacks, drinks and meals will be provided according to the [Seven Daily Hobbit Meals](http://askmiddlearth.tumblr.com/post/41765286488/the-seven-daily-hobbit-meals) (does Postmates know about second breakfast?). Costumes are encouraged but not required. Let me know if you need my address. Happy Hobbit Day!
